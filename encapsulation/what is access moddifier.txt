#Let us see the access modifiers in Python to understand the concept of Encapsulation and data hiding −

#1. public: The public member is accessible from inside or outside the class.
#2. private: The private member is accessible only inside class. Define a private member by prefixing the member name with two underscores, for example − __age
#3. protected: Protected means that the attribute/method can only be used in the class where it is defined or its subclasses.
# Private and protected method or attributes are not accessible outside the classes
