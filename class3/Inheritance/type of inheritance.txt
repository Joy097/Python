4 types of inheritance:
1. single inheritance (one child)
2. multilevel inheritance (one child of every generation)
3. hirarchical inheritance (many child)
4. multiple inheritance (several parent of one child) (not much used)

errors:
when parent class is under the child class, then wont inherit the parent.
# when there are 2 parents, then how to access only one parent?
= child has all attributes of the parents. So, in this case, have to call
clid.parent2.name
